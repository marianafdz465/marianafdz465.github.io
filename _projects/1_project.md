**How Can Virtual Reality Transform Team Dynamics?**

Incorporating newcomers into established teams is essential for innovation but often hindered by familiarity bias among existing members. This project examines how Virtual Reality (VR) can reshape team dynamics, focusing on whether it enhances closeness and inclusion. 

We conducted a controlled between-subject experiment with 29 teams, comparing in-person (IP) interactions and VR sessions using Meta Horizon Workrooms. Teams comprised two incumbents and one newcomer, completing a collaborative hidden-profile task designed to encourage information sharing and discussion. We found that VR creates a safer, more engaging environment for newcomers, fostering a stronger sense of connection to the team. While VR did not significantly reduce incumbentsâ€™ familiarity bias, it offers valuable design insights for developing more inclusive collaborative systems.
